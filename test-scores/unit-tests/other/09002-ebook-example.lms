            (txt (style "normal") ", is a predefined series of notes going up (ascending) or down (descending). People in different musical traditions have different ideas about what notes they think sound best together. In the Western musical tradition - which includes most familiar music from Europe and the Americas - the octave is divided up into twelve equally spaced notes. Other musical traditions - traditional Chinese music for example - have divided the octave differently and so they use different scales.")
